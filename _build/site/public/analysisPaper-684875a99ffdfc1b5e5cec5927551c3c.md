Since the first recorded nuclear detonation, **Trinity**, occurred on July 16, 1945, more than 2056 nuclear explosions have been recorded as part of testing or warfare by at least eight nations. A substantial amount of these explosions occurred during or as a result of Cold War tensions between the U.S and USSR, who themselves account for nearly 85% of the total nuclear detonations in history. Additional countries who have conducted nuclear testing include The United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and South Korea.
