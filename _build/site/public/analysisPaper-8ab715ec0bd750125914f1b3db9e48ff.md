Since the first recorded nuclear detonation, **([Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(nuclear_test)))**, occurred on July 16, 1945, more than 2056 nuclear explosions have been recorded as part of testing or warfare by at least eight nations. A substantial amount of these explosions occurred during or as a result of Cold War tensions between the U.S and USSR, who themselves account for nearly 85% of the total nuclear detonations in history. Additional countries who have conducted nuclear testing include The United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and South Korea. Given the nuclear launch data, we can identify trends related to historical declarations and events that impact nuclear testing from 1940 to 2000.

## Background

Nuclear activity began rising directly after the detonation of the first bomb, Trinity, which ended the nuclear arms race of World War II. The release of the **([Trueman Doctrine](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/truman-doctrine))** in 1947 effectively initiated the Cold War, ushering in an age of nuclear activity far more violent than before. This incline in nuclear detonations during the late 1940’s to its climax in 1958 was briefly halted in 1959 by President Eisenhower with a **([Unilateral Testing Moratorium](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB94/))** banning the testing of nuclear weapons, only to resume more intensely in 1961 and 1962. Realizing their close proximity to nuclear war, U.S. President John F. Kennedy and USSR Premier Nikita Khrushchev signed The Limited Nuclear Test Ban treaty on September 23, 1963, halting all nuclear testing except that which occurred underground. Since then, nuclear testing has generally declined save the occasional rogue country’s power trip, mostly as a result of global efforts to reach “complete” nuclear disarmament.
